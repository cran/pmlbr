\title{pmlb: R interface to the Penn Machine Learning Benchmarks data repository}
\description{
The \href{https://github.com/EpistasisLab/pmlb}{PMLB} repository contains a curated collection of data sets for evaluating and
comparing machine learning algorithms.
These data sets cover a range of applications, and include binary/multi-class classification problems and regression problems,
as well as combinations of categorical, ordinal, and continuous features.  There are approximately 290 data sets included in the PMLB repository
and there are no missing values in these data sets.
}
\details{
This R library includes summaries of the classification and regression data sets but does NOT
include any of the PMLB data sets.  The data sets can be downloaded using the \code{\link{fetch_data}} function which
is similar to the corresponding PMLB python function.

See \code{\link{fetch_data}}, \code{\link{pmlb_metadata}} for usage examples and further information.

If you use PMLB in a scientific publication, please consider citing the following paper:
